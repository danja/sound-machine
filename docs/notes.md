Only started playing last night.

Contemplating adding an Arduino Mega 2560 to the testbed to handle all UI. Time for a quick inventory of my modules box.

Later...

I had a Mega module. Added. Only took a few minutes to connect up, set up a new project (https://github.com/danja/sound-machine-mega2560) and get it working with keypad & display.

The module was connected to a TFT display that had developed problems (damp?). Made me think it'd be a good idea to get a graphic display for this thing.
